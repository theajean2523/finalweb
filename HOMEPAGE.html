                <p>an 18-year-old first-year college student studying for a bachelor’s degree in computer studies.
                    Growing up, I’ve always been curious about how technology works, which sparked my passion for 
                    exploring the world of computer science. Outside of my studies, 
                    I've been learning to improve my dancing skills, and it's a greatway for me to build my 
                    confidence and express myself. I also enjoy traveling to different places and immersing myself in new cultures, 
                    which helps mesee the world from different perspectives. I’m really excited about my journey in computer science
                     and look forward to developing myskills and contributing to innovative projects in the field. 
                    I can’t wait to see where this path takes me! </p>
